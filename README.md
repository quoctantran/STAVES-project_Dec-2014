(Segmentation, symbol recognition and classification for printed and hand written music scores)

We use two system for musical recognition and classification : The DocRead system and BonzaiBoost. Indeed, each one will be in charge of a specific function. For example, the DocRead system will be responsible for analyzing the musical documents while the BonzaiBoost will classify the musical notations. Furthermore these tools are important but in order for us to fully take advantage of these tools, we will use the ILIB library, and these three tools will help working on these two purposes : 
— Building a new musical dataset of isolated symbols from musical scores, with the support of DocRead system and ILIB library, 
— Testing the performance of BonzaiBoost for the classification of isolated symbols extracted previously
